# How to contribute


## Reporting Issues

To report an issues or bug please use the [github issues page](https://github.com/maxrousseau/pfla/issues). 

Before opening a new issue make sure that it has not already been mentionned in
a previous thread.

When reporting on a problem make sure that your initial comment includes the
following:

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to pfla](https://github.com/maxrousseau/flask-pfla/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). 
Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
