Development server: https://stormy-hollows-38428.herokuapp.com
Nothing displaying there at the moment since there is no html, only an api.

	Here there is some html of a prototype: https://stormy-hollows-38428.herokuapp.com/api/v0.0/jobs

Curl command to post a new image (lena.png is in the current directory):

curl -g -i -H Content-Type:application/json -X POST -d '{"image":"lena.png", "analysis":"ratio1"}' http://stormy-hollows-38428.herokuapp.com/api/v0.0/jobs/new


This will return the following:

HTTP/1.1 201 CREATED

{"job":{"analysis":"ratio1","complete":false,"hash":"7c464f2b-638f-40dc-9b2a-17f10b84347c","id":0,"image":"lena.png","result":"0.6402731106762761","resultimg_path":"/app/db/img/7c464f2b-638f-40dc-9b2a-17f10b84347c_ratio1.png"}}


There are currently 5 analysis that are possible: 
- 'ratio1'
- 'ratio2'
- 'ratio3'
- 'lfh'
- 'asym'


TODO:
- figure out how to upload an image to the server before calling the analysis
